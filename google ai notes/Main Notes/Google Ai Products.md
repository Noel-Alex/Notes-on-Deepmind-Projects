>“Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. The ultimate search engine that would understand everything on the web. It would understand exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. We’re nowhere near doing that now. However, we can get incrementally closer to that, and that is basically what we work on.”
—Larry Page

>“The pace of progress in artificial intelligence (I’m not referring to narrow AI) is incredibly fast. Unless you have direct exposure to groups like Deepmind, you have no idea how fast—it is growing at a pace close to exponential. The risk of something seriously dangerous happening is in the five-year time frame. 10 years at most.”

 Led by CEO Demis Hassabis, Google Deepmind brings together Google Brain and Deepmind, two of the World's Leading AI Labs
 DeepMind started in 2010, with an interdisciplinary approach to building general AI systems. The research lab brought together new ideas and advances in machine learning, neuroscience, engineering, mathematics, simulation and computing infrastructure, along with new ways of organizing scientific endeavors.  
 
 The lab achieved early success by pioneering the field of deep reinforcement learning - a combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning - and using games to test its systems. One of its early breakthroughs was a program called [DQN](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning/), which learned to play 49 different Atari games from scratch just by observing the raw pixels on the screen and being told to maximize the score.
 
 In 2015, DeepMind unveiled [AlphaGo](https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago), the first computer program to defeat a Go world champion. Go was a long-standing grand challenge in AI and AlphaGo’s landmark achievement was considered a decade ahead of its time. AlphaGo inspired a new era of AI systems and its successors, [AlphaZero](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go) and [MuZero](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules), are increasingly general and able to solve many different games as well as complex real-world problems, from compressing [YouTube videos](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/muzeros-first-step-from-research-into-the-real-world) to discovering [new more efficient computer algorithms](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphadev-discovers-faster-sorting-algorithms).



# Gemini and the Astra Project
[**Gemini**](Gemini%20notes.md) is a large language model developed by Google AI. It's designed to be more versatile and capable than previous models, able to perform a wide range of tasks such as generating text, translating languages, writing different kinds of creative content, and answering your questions in an informative way.  

**The Astra Project** is a research initiative aimed at developing advanced AI technologies, including Gemini. It focuses on pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities and exploring potential applications that could benefit society.

**Key features and capabilities of Gemini:**

- **Versatility:** Capable of performing a wide range of tasks, from writing different kinds of creative content to answering your questions in an informative way.
- **Efficiency:** Designed to be highly efficient, able to process and generate text quickly and accurately.
- **Scalability:** Can be scaled to handle large amounts of data and complex tasks.
- **Safety:** Prioritizes safety and is designed to minimize harmful outputs.

**The Astra Project's goals:**

- **Advance AI research:** Explore new AI techniques and technologies.
- **Develop beneficial applications:** Create AI solutions that can improve people's lives.
- **Ensure responsible AI:** Promote safe and ethical AI development.

**Overall, Gemini and the Astra Project represent a significant step forward in AI research and development, with the potential to have a profound impact on various fields.**


# Veo
[**VEO**](VEO%20notes.md) is Google's state of the art text to video ai model that generates high resolution videos that last even over a minute in different cinematic styles and understands prompts for all kinds of cinematic effects, like time lapses or aerial shots of a landscape.


# AlphaFold
[AlphaFold](AlphaFold%20Notes), developed by DeepMind, is an AI model designed to predict the 3D structures of proteins from their amino acid sequences with near-experimental accuracy. It uses a deep learning approach, particularly transformers, to model spatial relationships within proteins, identifying folding patterns based on sequence data. A key innovation in AlphaFold 2, the Evoformer module, leverages evolutionary data to refine these predictions further. AlphaFold has significantly advanced scientific understanding, aiding drug discovery, genomics, and structural biology by providing fast, reliable protein structure predictions.
