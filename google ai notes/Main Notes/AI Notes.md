# Introduction to AI

#### Why do we need AI, what makes it different?
AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to machines designed to simulate human-like intelligence by learning from data, recognizing patterns, and making decisions or predictions. Unlike traditional programming, where developers explicitly code rules and instructions for specific tasks, AI models are trained to learn from vast amounts of data. This allows AI to adapt and solve complex, dynamic problems that would be difficult or impossible to define using fixed rules. AI systems can improve over time, handling ambiguity and making inferences, making them ideal for tasks like natural language processing, image recognition, and predictive analytics.
